# L4T-Megascript
We did the hard parts so you don't have to - a multipurpose script for updating and installing things like Dolphin, RetroArch, Moonlight, the joycon mouse config, and more! Can be used with this command: bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/N-Games/L4T-Megascript/master/core.sh)"
